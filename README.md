## About large-scale phase retrieval and reported method
High-throughput computational imaging requires efficient processing algorithms to retrieve multi-dimensional and multi-scale information. In computational phase imaging, phase retrieval (PR) is required to reconstruct both amplitude and phase in complex space from intensity-only measurements. The existing PR algorithms suffer from the tradeoff among
low computational complexity, robustness to measurement noise and strong generalization on different modalities. In this work, we report an efficient large-scale phase retrieval technique termed as LPR. It extends the plug-and-play generalized-alternating-projection framework
from real space to nonlinear complex space. The alternating projection solver and enhancing
neural network are respectively derived to tackle the measurement formation and statistical
prior regularization. This framework compensates the shortcomings of each operator, so as
to realize high-fidelity phase retrieval with low computational complexity and strong generalization.


## Usage
