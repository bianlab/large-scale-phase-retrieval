%%                   testFienup.m

% This test file implements the Fienup solver. The code builds
% a synthetic formulation of the Phase Retrieval problem, b = |Ax| and
% computes an estimate to x. The code finally plots a convergence curve
% and also makes a scatter plot of the true vs recovered solution.

% 1) Each test script starts out by defining the length of the unknown
% signal, n and the number of measurements, m. These mesurements can be
% made complex by setting the isComplex flag to be true.
%
% 2) We then build the test problem by invoking the function
% 'buildTestProblem' which generates random gaussian measurements according
% to the user's choices in step(1). The function returns the measurement 
% matrix 'A', the true signal 'xt' and the measurements 'b0'.
%
% 3) We set the options for the PR solver. For example, the maximum
% number of iterations, the tolerance value, the algorithm and initializer
% of choice. These options are controlled by setting the corresponding
% entries in the 'opts' struct.  Please see the user guide for a complete 
% list of options.
%
% 4) We solve the phase retrieval problem by running the following line 
% of code:
%   >>  [x, outs, opts] = solvePhaseRetrieval(A, A', b0, n, opts)
% This solves the problem using the algorithm and initialization scheme
% specified by the user in the struct 'opts'.
%
% 5) Determine the optimal phase rotation so that the recovered solution
% matches the true solution as well as possible.
%
% 6) Report the relative reconstruction error. Plot residuals (a measure
% of error) against the number of iterations and plot the real part of the 
% recovered signal against the real part of the original signal.
