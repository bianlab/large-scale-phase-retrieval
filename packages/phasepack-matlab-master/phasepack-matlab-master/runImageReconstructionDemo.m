% This script will create phaseless measurements from a test image, and 
% then recover the image using phase retrieval methods.  We now describe 
% the details of the simple recovery problem that this script implements.
% 
%                         Recovery Problem
% This script loads a test image, and converts it to grayscale.
% Measurements of the image are then obtained by applying a linear operator
% to the image, and computing the magnitude (i.e., removing the phase) of 
% the linear measurements.
%
%                       Measurement Operator
% Measurement are obtained using a linear operator, called 'A', that 
% obtains masked Fourier measurements from an image.  Measurements are 
% created by multiplying the image (coordinate-wise) by a 'mask,' and then
% computing the Fourier transform of the product.  There are 8 masks,
% each of which is an array of binary (+1/-1) variables. The output of
% the linear measurement operator contains the Fourier modes produced by 
% all 8 masks.  The measurement operator, 'A', is defined as a separate 
% function near the end of the file.  The adjoint/transpose of the
% measurement operator is also defined, and is called 'At'.
%
%                         Data structures
% PhasePack assumes that unknowns take the form of vectors (rather than 2d
% images), and so we will represent our unknowns and measurements as a 
% 1D vector rather than 2D images.
%
%                      The Recovery Algorithm
% The image is recovered by calling the method 'solvePhaseRetrieval', and
% handing the measurement operator and linear measurements in as arguments.
% A struct containing options is also handed to 'solvePhaseRetrieval'.
% The entries in this struct specify which recovery algorithm is used.
%
% For more details, see the Phasepack user guide.
